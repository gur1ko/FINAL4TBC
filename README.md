Coin Collection Management System
I know one good man who collects coins and banknotes, but whenever I meet him, he always complains about organizing his vast collection. That little story was my inspiration for this console application, and here it is.

This application helps coin collectors manage their collections with ease. It provides features for user registration, login, and various inventory management functionalities.
